Generates documentation for a method using OpenAI's GPT3.5 Turbo model (i.e. ChatGPT)

<p>
  Sends your source code to OpenAI's API and asks it to generate a Javadoc comment for the method,
  which is then placed directly above it. Please note that the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY must be set to your API key to use this intention.
